**Football Analysis System Using YOLO, Optical Flow, and Perspective Transformation**
**1. Introduction**
Objective: To create a football analysis system that detects and tracks players, referees, and footballs on the field, assigns players to teams based on their t-shirt colors, and calculates player movement in terms of speed and distance.
Technologies: Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Deep Learning, YOLO, Optical Flow, Perspective Transformation.
**2. Components of the System**
YOLO Object Detection:
Using YOLO (You Only Look Once) to detect objects like players, referees, and footballs in video frames.
Steps:
Use pre-trained YOLOv8 for initial detection.
Train a custom YOLO model to improve accuracy for your specific dataset (custom players, referees).
Trackers:
Track detected objects across multiple video frames to ensure continuity in tracking each player/referee/football.
**3. Player Team Assignment Using T-shirt Color**
KMeans for Pixel Segmentation:
Cluster pixels to segment out player t-shirts from the background.
Assign each player to a team based on t-shirt color.
**4. Camera Movement and Player Tracking**
Optical Flow:
Measure the camera's movement between frames.
Helps in differentiating camera motion from player motion.
**5. Depth and Distance Calculation**
Perspective Transformation:
Convert 2D pixel data into 3D space to measure actual distances (meters) on the field.
Accurately represent depth in video frames using OpenCV's cv2.perspectiveTransform.
**6. Player Speed and Distance Measurement**
Speed Calculation:
Measure player movement across frames and calculate speed in meters per second.
Formula: Speed = Distance / Time (based on perspective-transformed measurements).
Distance Covered:
Calculate the total distance each player covers during the game using tracked positions over time.
**7. System Workflow**
Input: Video footage of a football match.
Object Detection: YOLO detects players, referees, and the football.
Tracking: Track each object across frames.
Team Assignment: Use KMeans to segment players by t-shirt color.
Camera Adjustment: Apply optical flow to adjust for camera movements.
Distance & Speed Calculation: Use perspective transformation and tracking to measure player movements.
**8. Challenges & Solutions**
Occlusion Handling: Handling situations when players overlap in video frames.
Lighting Variations: Managing different lighting conditions affecting object detection and t-shirt color segmentation.
**9. Conclusion**
A comprehensive system that combines various techniques to solve real-world football analysis problems.
Enhances game analysis by tracking player movements, detecting teams, and measuring performance metrics like speed and distance.
